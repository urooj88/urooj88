Hi, I’m Urooj!
I’m a PhD student at TU Dublin studying energy-efficient high-performance computing.
I build tools to measure, analyse, and reduce the energy cost of HPC workloads, from matrix multiplication to ML and LLM inference.
Passionate about sustainable computing, parallel programming, and practical optimisation.
